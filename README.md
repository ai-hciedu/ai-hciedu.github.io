We propose this workshop at the MexIHC 2024 to convene academic and industry professionals interested in exchanging viewpoints and approaches on how Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more specifically, Generative Artificial Intelligence can be accounted for in responsible yet productive ways when designing courses and lessons in the multidisciplinary field of Human-Computer Interaction. At the workshop, we will discuss the participantsâ€™ experiences and perspectives, and also will conduct a practical activity to codesign HCI lessons while keeping responsible AI in mind. Ultimately, we aim to facilitate the development of a new community around the topic of Responsible AI in HCI Education.
